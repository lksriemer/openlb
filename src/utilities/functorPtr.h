/// Smart pointer for managing the various ways of passing functors around
/**
 * There is a rich set of functors that compose other functors by accepting
 * them as constructor arguments. e.g. SuperLpNorm3D, SuperPlaneIntegralF3D
 *
 * Previously all of these functors only accepted other functors by reference
 * which prevented e.g. the use case of accepting a std::unique_ptr to a
 * indicator freshly created by SuperGeometry3D::getMaterialIndicator.
 *
 * This class hides the memory management required to support accepting either
 * functor references, non-owning pointers or owning unique pointers in a single
 * argument.
