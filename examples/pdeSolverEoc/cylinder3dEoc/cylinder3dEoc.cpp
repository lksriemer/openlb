/* cylinder3d.cpp:
 * This example examines a steady flow past a cylinder placed in a channel.
 * The cylinder is offset somewhat from the center of the flow to make the
 * steady-state symmetrical flow unstable. At the inlet, a Poiseuille profile is
 * imposed on the velocity, whereas the outlet implements a Dirichlet pressure
 * condition set by p = 0.
 * Inspired by "Benchmark Computations of Laminar Flow Around
 * a Cylinder" by M.Sch√§fer and S.Turek. For high resolution, low
 * latticeU, and enough time to converge, the results for pressure drop, drag
 * and lift lie within the estimated intervals for the exact results.
 * An unsteady flow with Karman vortex street can be created by changing the
 * Reynolds number to Re=100.
 * It also shows the usage of the STL-reader and explains how
 * to set boundary conditions automatically.
 * It illustrates the error analysis.
