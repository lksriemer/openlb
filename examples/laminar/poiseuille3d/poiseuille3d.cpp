/* poiseuille3d.cpp:
 * This example examines a 3D Poseuille flow
 * It illustrates the usage of different flow setups, boundary conditions
 * and computation of error norms.
 * The following simulation options can be combined freely:
 * - if the compiler flag ENABLE_MRT is set, mrt collision operators are used
 * - forced/ nonForced flow
 * - different boundary conditions
 * - simulation only or eoc convergence analysis
 */

//#define ENABLE_MRT

#include "poiseuille3d.h"

//Initialize Gnuplot
